# A2-Creations-Python-Development-internship
It is a internship opportunity
To complete the task, we will build a Python script using Selenium for scraping, incorporating proxies to avoid IP bans, and saving the extracted data into a CSV file. After extracting the data, we will analyze the products and create useful insights like the most expensive product, the cheapest product, the number of products from each brand, and the number of products by each seller.

Libraries Used:
Selenium for web scraping.
Pandas for data manipulation and storing the extracted data into CSV format.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
Requests and Fake User Agent for proxies and rotating user agents.
Code Breakdown
Setup Browser with Proxies & User-Agent:

The setup_browser function configures the Chrome WebDriver to use a random user-agent and allows the use of proxies to rotate IPs and prevent scraping blocks.
Scraping Data:

scrape_products scrapes product information like:
Product Name
Price
Brand
Seller
Rating
Product Link
It uses XPath to locate product elements on the page.
Saving Data to CSV:

The extracted product details are saved into a CSV file using Python's built-in CSV library.
Analyzing Data:

analyze_data uses Pandas to load the CSV, clean the data (convert prices to numeric), and perform the following analyses:
Find the most expensive and cheapest products.
Count the number of products from each brand and seller.
Matplotlib is used to generate bar charts for the product counts by brand and seller.
2. Proxies Setup
If you need to set up rotating proxies, you can modify the setup_browser function. Hereâ€™s how you would add a proxy:

python
Copy code
chrome_options.add_argument('--proxy-server=http://your_proxy_here')
You can integrate a proxy rotation system by using a list of proxies and selecting a random proxy for each request.

3. Running the Script
Install the required libraries:
Download and install the ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version.
Run the script and it will scrape the data, save it to CSV, and analyze it.
Output Analysis
Most Expensive Product: The product with the highest price will be identified.
Cheapest Product: The product with the lowest price will be identified.
Number of Products by Each Brand: A bar chart will display the number of products available from each brand.
Number of Products by Each Seller: A bar chart will display the number of products available from each seller.
Conclusion
This Python script uses Selenium for scraping, incorporates proxies to avoid detection, and saves the scraped data into a CSV file. It also analyzes the data by calculating insights like the most expensive product, cheapest product, and product distribution by brand and seller. The visualizations provide additional insights into the product data.
